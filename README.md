# ðŸŽ¬Movie Budget and Revenue Prediction using Seaborn & SciKit-Learn Linear Regression of Python

ðŸŒŸThe question we want to answer today is: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more? 

ðŸŒŸTo answer this question, we will be using Seaborn library for Data Visualization and the Scikit-Learn library for Data & Model prediction.

âœ…The answer is obtained using various methods, some of which are:

ðŸ‘‰Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns

ðŸ‘‰Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query()

ðŸ‘‰Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library!

ðŸ‘‰Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters

ðŸ‘‰Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades

ðŸ‘‰Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data

ðŸ‘‰Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric

ðŸ‘‰Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients

ðŸŒŸIn this way, we have used various methods and implemented this Data Prediction Model:
